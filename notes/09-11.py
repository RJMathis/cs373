1. no exception was raised
2. exception was raised and handled
3. exception was raised and not handled

a raise in an except clause always goes to the next higher try block

except clauses of types in a class hierarchy must list children first

Questions:
    What were the two bugs in IsPrime1?
    What was the inefficiency in IsPrime1?
    In using a parameter for error handling, why was a list passed?
    	bc if we pass a variable it gets copied
    Could an int have been passed?
    	no, it would not have been reflected in the calling function
    Could a tuple have been passed?
    	no, tuples are immutable and a new tuple would have been created
    What's the diffence between code in an else clause and code after the try block?
    What's the diffence between code in a finally clause and code after the try block?
